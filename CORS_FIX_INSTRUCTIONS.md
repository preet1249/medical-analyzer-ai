# CORS Fix and Persistent Login Implementation

## Issues Fixed

1. **CORS Error**: Backend was configured to allow `https://medical-report-analyzes.vercel.app` (with 's') but frontend is deployed at `https://medical-report-analyzer-d26v.vercel.app` (without 's').

2. **Persistent Login**: Users were not staying logged in when reopening the app.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (server.js)

1. **Updated CORS Configuration**: Now allows multiple origins including:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - `https://medical-report-analyzer-d26v.vercel.app` (current frontend)
   - `https://medical-report-analyzes.vercel.app` (backup URL)
   - Any additional URL from `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

2. **Enhanced CORS Headers**: Added proper methods and headers for better compatibility.

### Frontend Changes

1. **Created Authentication Context** (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):
   - Centralized authentication state management
   - Automatic token validation on app load
   - Persistent login across browser sessions

2. **Created AuthGuard Component** (`/components/AuthGuard.tsx`):
   - Protects routes that require authentication
   - Shows loading spinner during auth checks
   - Redirects to login if not authenticated

3. **Updated Pages**:
   - Login page now uses the auth context
   - Dashboard is wrapped with AuthGuard
   - Home page redirects to dashboard if already logged in
   - Navbar uses auth context for user info and logout

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes

1. Commit and push the backend changes to your repository
2. Your Render deployment should automatically update
3. Ensure these environment variables are set in Render:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://medical-report-analyzer-d26v.vercel.app
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Changes

1. Commit and push the frontend changes to your repository
2. Vercel should automatically deploy the changes
3. Ensure the `.env.local` file contains:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://medical-report-analyzer-qotn.onrender.com
   ```

### 3. Verify the Fix

1. Clear your browser cache and localStorage
2. Try logging in to your app
3. Close the browser tab and reopen - you should stay logged in
4. Check browser console for any CORS errors (there should be none)

## How Persistent Login Works Now

1. **On Login**: 
   - Token and user data are stored in localStorage
   - User state is updated in AuthContext

2. **On App Load**:
   - AuthContext checks for existing token in localStorage
   - Validates token by calling `/api/auth/me` endpoint
   - If valid, user stays logged in
   - If invalid, localStorage is cleared

3. **On Logout**:
   - localStorage is cleared
   - User state is reset
   - Backend logout endpoint is called

4. **Route Protection**:
   - Dashboard and other protected routes use AuthGuard
   - Automatically redirects to login if not authenticated
   - Shows loading spinner during authentication checks

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
2. **Check Render logs** for any backend errors
3. **Verify environment variables** in both Render and Vercel
4. **Ensure both deployments are using the latest code**

The app should now work reliably with persistent login and no CORS errors!
